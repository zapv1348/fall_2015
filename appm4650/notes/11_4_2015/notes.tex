\section{Throwing out Terms}
\[y'=y+x\]
\[y(0)=0\]
assume $y$ is the smallest.\\
\[y'\approx x\]
\[y\approx \frac{x^2}{2}+c\]
$c=0$ by init condition\\


Now assume x is the smallest.\\
\[y'=y\]
\[y\approx ce^x\]
$c=0$ to satisy ic.\\
breaks assumption.\\
tested others, but the only one that works is y is smallest.\\

you can take the $y=\frac{x^2}{2!}$ term and plug it into $y'$ to evaluate.\\
repeat this over and over and you will get $y=e^x-x-1$.\\

\section{Projects}
rate of reaction $e^{\frac{-E}{RT}}$ proportional to the number of molecules with sufficient energy to react.\\
RT $\sim$ measure of thermal energy level of room.\\
E activation energy for $F+0x$ reaction!.\\
\[\frac{PV}{h}=RT\]
$A_f\sim$ amount of fuel in box.\\
\[\frac{dA_f}{dt}=-cA_fe^{\frac{-E}{RT}}\]
Conservation of energy.\\
\[\frac{d}{dt}(\text{thermal energy in box})=\dot{Q}_{\text{all}}\]
fuel reaction.\\
\[\Delta E=Q+(W=0)\]
\[\rho c_p\frac{dT}{dt}=-c\frac{dA_f}{dt}\]
