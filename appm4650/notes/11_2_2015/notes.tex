\section{predictor corrector methods}
use some method to determine prediction for $y_{i+1}$ at $x_{i+1}$. Then co back and fix it.\\
start with euler's improved method.\\
typically predict with adams-bashford\\
correct with adam's m\\
Akwardly enough, you don't have enough points at the beginning.\\
Could use RK4 for a few small points, to get what's known as seed values.\\
Taylor series expansion is also an options.\\

now think about real problems and that units always have to match.\\


look at what is called the early solution.\\
